# taskify: cli todo app

## description
Taskly is a command-line to-do app that allows users to manage tasks. It provides functionality to add, update, delete, mark as completed, and list tasks. The app offers a simple interface for users to interact with their tasks directly from the terminal. Inspiration came from https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

## features
- Add a task: Users can add a task with a short description. Each task has a unique ID for easy management.
- Update a task: Users can use the task ID to change the description after it's already been created. 
- Mark a task: Users can use the task ID to change the status of a task (todo, in progress, done).
- Delete a task: Users can use the task ID to delete a pre-existing task.
- List tasks: Users can list all tasks or filter based on what status they are. Each task has it's own creation date/time as well as the date/time they were last changed.
